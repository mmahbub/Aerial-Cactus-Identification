This repo contains the implementations of some supervised and unsupervised pattern recognition techniques with a goal to identify the presence of columnar cactus in a Kaggle competition data set of aerial images. The supervised learning algorithms that were used include parametric Maximum A-Posteriori Probability, non-parametric k-Nearest Neighbors, back propagating Neural Network, convolutional neural network and Support Vector Machine. The parameters in parametric learning algorithms are calculated using maximum likelihood estimation. For unsupervised learning algorithms, k-means, winner-take-all and Kohonen's Self Organizing Maps have been utilized. One non-statistical approach, decision tree were also used to classify the data set. In addition to that, two classifier fusion techniques: Naive Bayes and Behavior Knowledge Space were employed in order to improve the classification accuracy. For evaluation of these variety of classifiers receiver operating curves and confusion matrices have been used. 100\% accuracy has been achieved from CNN and from BKS classifier fusion of kNN and decision tree.
